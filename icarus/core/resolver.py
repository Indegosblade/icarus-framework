"""
ICARUS Entity Resolver — Atom/Bag/EventLog pattern for cross-source identity.

EXPERIMENTAL: the API and resolution behavior are still unstable and may
change. The subsystem IS wired to users: the ``icarus resolve`` CLI command
atomizes one or more source databases and resolves them into a shared output,
and ``icarus build --resolve`` optionally runs an in-build resolve phase (see
``icarus.core.pipeline.create_default_pipeline``). Direct use still requires
acknowledging the experimental flag: construct
``EntityResolver(db_path, experimental=True)``.

Entities from different sources may refer to the same real-world thing under
different identifiers. The resolver tracks immutable atoms (raw observations),
groups them into bags (resolved entities), and logs every resolution decision
in an append-only event log. Two resolution entry points are offered:
``resolve``, an exact-key-blocking MVP (identical normalized values or
nothing), and ``resolve_scored``, the full block -> score -> cluster -> merge
pipeline over atoms fed by ``icarus.core.atomize`` (see each method's own
docstring for details).

        *unresolved* atoms of ``entity_type``:

        1. **block** — :func:`~icarus.core.matching.candidate_pairs` generates
           plausibly-same-entity atom pairs (restricted here to unresolved
           atoms on both ends).
        2. **score** — :func:`~icarus.core.matching.score_pair` assigns each
           candidate a similarity in ``[0, 1]``. *Every* scored candidate is
           persisted to ``match_candidates`` (score + JSON features) so the
           decision is auditable, not just the ones that clear the bar.
        3. **cluster** — :func:`~icarus.core.matching.cluster` union-finds the
           pairs scoring ``>= threshold`` into connected components, so a chain
           ``a~b~c`` merges even without a direct ``a~c`` edge.
        4. **merge** — each multi-atom component becomes one bag whose
           ``canonical_key`` is the ``source_key`` of its smallest-id member
           and whose ``bags.score`` is the mean of that component's in-cluster
           match-edge scores; a ``"resolve"`` event carrying that confidence is
           logged. Every still-unresolved atom outside all components gets a
           1-atom singleton bag (score left NULL).

        ``threshold`` is the score cutoff for a candidate to count as a match
        edge. Results are fully auditable via the ``match_candidates`` rows,
        ``bags.score``, and the resolution event log.

        Returns ``{"clusters": C, "merges": E, "atoms_resolved": N}`` where
        ``C`` is the number of multi-atom bags created, ``E`` the number of
