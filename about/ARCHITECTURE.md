# ICARUS Architecture

## Design Philosophy

Structured data sources contain implicit relationships that are invisible at the individual-file level but obvious at the relational-query level. ICARUS makes those relationships queryable.

## Design Decisions

### SQLite, Not Postgres

Single-file database. No server process, no configuration. The output is one `.db` file you can copy anywhere and query with any SQLite client. The only runtime dependency is Python's built-in `sqlite3` module.

### Streaming Extraction

Parsers process records individually with periodic commits. Source data is never loaded into memory as a whole. SQLite memory-mapped I/O and page cache scale to available system RAM automatically. The streaming design ensures correctness (bounded memory regardless of source size), not artificial memory restriction.

### Safe Traversal

Parsers use `os.walk(onerror=lambda e: None)` instead of `pathlib.rglob()`. This handles broken symlinks, inaccessible paths, and permission-denied directories without crashing the pipeline. SQLite connections are wrapped in `try/finally` so they release on any failure.

### Parser Ecosystem

The framework itself has no knowledge of platform-specific formats. Parsers provide that. Each parser ships with a YAML manifest (validated by JSON Schema), declares a quality tier and specificity level, and participates in a registry contest for auto-detection. Generic fallback parsers ensure every directory produces output. The candidate `macos` parser targets iOS/macOS daemon attack-surface mapping, reading Mach-O entitlements with a self-contained stdlib reader — no external `codesign` or `ldid`.

A test harness enforces 4 quality gates: golden output match, idempotency, schema conformance, and zero-PII verification.

### First-Class Diffing

The differ attaches two databases and runs set-difference queries directly in SQLite. Five diff categories cover additions, deletions, property changes, structural topology changes, and resolution changes.

### Built-in Sanitization

HYGEIA runs as a pipeline phase, not a separate post-processing step. PII is stripped before the database is marked complete.

### Cell-Level Provenance

Every entity row carries:
- `source_version_id` — which pipeline run produced it (FK to `versions`)
- `confidence` — 0.0-1.0, parser confidence
- `observed_time` — ISO 8601 timestamp
- `marking` — access classification: `UNCLASSIFIED`, `PII`, `SENSITIVE`, `REDACTED`

The `versions` table records every pipeline run with UUID, parser name, source path, timestamps, and entity count.

### Two-Graph Architecture

A single database contains two complementary graphs:

- **Ontology graph** — entities (files, binaries, daemons, kexts, frameworks) and their relationships. Structural, slow-moving.
- **Event graph** — observations (temporal events) and resolution decisions (atoms grouped into bags). Temporal, fast-moving.

Cross-graph queries join them naturally.

### Entity Resolution (Atom/Bag/EventLog)

When the same entity appears in different sources under different identifiers:

- **Atoms** — immutable property bundles. One per observation per source. Never modified.
- **Bags** — resolved entity groups. Merge and split with full reversibility.
- **Event log** — append-only record of every resolution decision.

Candidate pairs are generated by exact-key blocking (an equality bucket on a chosen key) rather than an O(n^2) all-pairs comparison. The resolver is experimental and excluded from the beta stability promise.

### STIX 2.1 Interoperability

ICARUS entities map to STIX 2.1 objects:
- `files` -> File SCO
- `binaries` -> File SCO with extensions
- `daemons` -> Infrastructure SDO
- `entitlements` -> Course of Action SDO
- `observations` -> Observed Data SDO for SCO targets; Sighting SRO for SDO targets

Diffs export as STIX Note objects with addition, deletion, property-change,
and structural classifications.

## Schema (v6)

17 normalized tables. 3 FTS indexes. 3 intelligence views. The authoritative DDL lives
in `icarus/core/schema.py`; `schema/icarus_schema.sql` is a generated v6 reference dump.

| Layer | Tables |
|-------|--------|
| Ontology | files, binaries, daemons, mach_services, entitlements, sandbox_profiles, sandbox_rules, kexts, frameworks |
| Infrastructure | metadata, versions |
| Events | observations |
| Resolution | atoms, bags, bag_atoms, resolution_event_log, match_candidates |
| Search | files_fts, daemons_fts, atoms_fts |
| Views | v_sandbox_escape_surface, v_kernel_attack_surface, v_test_binaries |

`mach_services` normalizes each launchd Mach service name to the daemon that vends it — the Mach-service -> daemon reachability pivot for attack-surface queries. `match_candidates` (added in v6) records audited scored atom pairs from the experimental resolver.

Migration chain: v2 -> v3 -> v4 -> v5 -> v6. Applied automatically on database open.
