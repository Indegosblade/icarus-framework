# ICARUS Threat Model

## Assets

- **A1 — The source tree under analysis.** Often *untrusted* (firmware image, container
  export, someone else's rootfs) and possibly *adversarial*.
- **A2 — The intelligence database.** The product's output; used for security decisions.
- **A3 — The "sanitized" database.** The artifact intended to be *safe to share*.
- **A4 — STIX exports.** Meant to interoperate with external threat-intel tooling.
- **A5 — Secrets present in the source or the host** (passwords, WireGuard keys, tokens).

## Actors

- **Analyst (trusted):** runs ICARUS locally.
- **Source-tree author (untrusted → adversarial):** controls file names, symlinks,
  archives, plists, JSON, and binaries in A1.
- **DB recipient (semi-trusted):** receives A3/A4 and trusts the "sanitized"/"valid"
  labels.
- **Dependency/CI supply chain:** the HYGEIA git dependency, GitHub Actions, entry-point
  plugins.

## Trust boundaries & entry points

1. **A1 → parser** (ingest). The primary boundary; input is attacker-controlled.
2. **A2 → query/diff/STIX** (consumers of a possibly-hostile DB file).
3. **A3 → external world** (sharing). Requires A3 to actually be clean.
4. **Installed distribution → runtime** (package integrity).
5. **`icarus.parsers` entry-point plugins** — any installed distribution advertising the
   group has its code imported at `import icarus.parsers` time (trusted-by-Python, but
   undocumented).
6. **Dependencies / CI actions** (supply chain).

## Abuse cases → mitigation status

| # | Abuse case | Mitigation | Residual (issue) |
|---|---|---|---|
| AC1 | In-root symlink points outside the tree; parser reads host files into A2/A3 | symlinks cataloged, never dereferenced or traversed | **Fixed/merged (#43 → #62)** |
| AC2 | Secret in A1 ends up in A3 and is shared as "clean" | HYGEIA canonical + fail-closed + mandatory post-sanitize gate | **Fixed/merged (#41/#42 → #59)** |
| AC3 | Malformed/huge/nested input exhausts memory or hangs the run | FIFO skip, surrogate-escape, depth/decompression budgets | **Fixed/merged (#47 → #62)** — residual: cloudtrail size cap (#25) |
| AC4 | Hostile file **name/path** injects into the diff Markdown report | none | **Open (#35)** |
| AC5 | Recipient trusts an invalid STIX bundle / dangling refs | deterministic RFC-4122 `uuid5` ids, valid refs/timestamps | **Fixed/merged (#21 → #61)** |
| AC6 | Consumer acts on a false "moved"/"reassigned" diff edge | natural-key diff throughout | **Fixed/merged — structural_diff + observation_diff + stable entitlement owner (#38)** |
| AC7 | Untrusted **SQLite** input opened read-write / runs on hostile DB | diff opens `mode=ro&immutable=1` | Diff safe; verify `sqlite_parser`/`query` paths |
| AC8 | Malicious entry-point plugin executes on import | Python trust model | Document + consider opt-in plugin loading |
| AC9 | Dependency tag moved / unreproducible build | version pin (tag) | **Movable tag; git-URL dep (#32/#49)** |
| AC10 | Orphan/inconsistent FK data persisted silently | schema `REFERENCES` + enforced pragma | **Fixed/merged — FK ON on every write path + verify-phase `foreign_key_check` gate (#54)** |

## Confidentiality / Integrity / Availability / Supply-chain split

- **Confidentiality:** AC1 (symlink read-out), AC2 (secret leak), SAN-07 (verifier echoes
  secret). **Highest-priority class — two blockers.**
- **Integrity:** AC5 (invalid STIX → fixed #61), AC6 (false diffs → fixed #38), AC10
  (orphan FKs → fixed #54), provenance (#40 → fixed #60), forward-version relabel
  (#39 → fixed #53). Residual: checkpoint wrong-DB (#45).
- **Availability:** AC3 (DoS via hostile input, #47).
- **Supply-chain:** AC8 (plugins), AC9 (git dep + mutable action pins, #49).

## Accepted residual risk (owner to ratify)

- Entry-point plugin execution is inherent to Python packaging (document it).
- The noncommercial license and private-repo status limit exposure *today*; a public
  release removes that mitigation and makes AC1–AC5 live.
