"""Regression: built artifacts must ship parser manifests, the manifest JSON
Schema, and the parser catalogs — not only the .py files.

Guards the packaging defect where ``[tool.setuptools.package-data]`` declared only
``py.typed``, so the wheel and sdist shipped no ``*.yaml`` / ``*.json`` runtime data.
On such an install, ``icarus parser list`` reported every parser as tier "unknown"
and ``icarus parser validate`` raised FileNotFoundError on the schema, while CI stayed
green because it installs the project editable (files present on disk in the source
tree). These tests build the real artifacts and assert the data is present.
